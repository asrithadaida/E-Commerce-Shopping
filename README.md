# UI Design Asritha - 
UI development in an Android application involves capturing crucial information about the layout, components, styling, and logic associated 
with the user interface. The documentation includes an overview of the UI component or screen, detailing its purpose and functionality. It encompasses the XML 
layout structure, specifying layout types (e.g., RelativeLayout, LinearLayout) and documenting each UI component with its attributes and purpose. Additional 
information covers styles and themes, images/icons, behavior, logic (such as click listeners), accessibility considerations, testing procedures, localization, 
version control practices, dependencies, references to design documents, and a changelog for tracking UI-related changes over time. This structured approach 
ensures comprehensive documentation, aiding developers in understanding, collaborating, and maintaining the UI throughout the lifecycle of the Android application.
