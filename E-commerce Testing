1. To test any application, we need to first write down the test cases for any application and same as for our e-commerce site as well.
2. Then we have to do the manual testing from start to end and need to test all the test cases using manual testing.
3. Manual testing is one of the testing process that has be done by human source.
4. Once the application is build, it will be in staging and test engineer will test the appkication, when it is approved by test engineer, the application    will be pushed to production. 
5. If there are any bugs in the application while testing, those issues will be raised in any repository like jira and will create tickets on the issues and assigned to developers.
6. Once all the issues are resolved and the application will be pushed to production.
