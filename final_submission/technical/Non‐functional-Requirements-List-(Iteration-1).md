Determining and describing non-functional requirements is one of the most important elements in ensuring the software project's overall success. These are some examples of common non-functional needs for Happy Feet. <br>

_1. Performance:_
* Response Time: The system should react efficiently to actions such as loading products, handling transactions, and performing searches. By retaining server maintenance and implementing parallel applications, we can do this.
* Scalability: The framework should be able to accommodate increasing numbers of users, shoe products, and transactions without significantly decreasing system performance.

_2. Security:_
* Data Encryption: Sensitive information like passwords and payment information should be transferred and kept safely using encryption methods.
* Access control: Access control must be implemented to make sure that only those with permission can do specific actions or access data, access control must be implemented.
* Authentication and Authorization: To prevent unwanted access, the system should include reliable processes for authenticating users and authorization.

_3. Reliability:_
* Error Handling: The system must treat problems with grace, providing users with informative error messages and keeping relevant information for troubleshooting.
* Data integrity: Ensure the accuracy of the data through implementing error-prevention strategies and verification processes.

_4. Usability:_
* Accessibility: Ensure that the system satisfies WCAG rules and is accessible by people with disabilities. 
* User interface: Maintain consistency in the layout, design, and functionality of user interface components. 
* Error handling: When there are failures or validation issues, give users concise, understandable error messages.

_5. Scalability:_
* Database Scalability: Without impacting performance, the database must be able to handle increasing data loads. 
* Managing the uploading and maintenance of several products: The system must be able to manage the transfer and preserving multiple products. 

_6.Maintainability:_
* Code Maintainability: To make future improvements and maintenance easier, the source code should be well-planned, documented, and modular.
* Database Schema Evolution: A database's structure must be designed so that it can change over time to fulfill new needs without experiencing significant downtime.

_7. Compatibility:_
* Cross-Browser Compatibility: To provide a consistent user experience, the web application needs to work with all popular web browsers.

_8. Availability:_
* Uptime: The network's performance should aim for high availability, reducing downtime due to repairs or unforeseen problems.
* Redundancy: To guarantee ongoing service availability, put redundancy measures in place such load managing and failover systems.

In addition to being reliable, secure, and long-maintainable, these non-functional requirements are essential for guaranteeing that the web application satisfies user, consumers, and compliance requirements.
